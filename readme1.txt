1. Run to get power-law figures
Select different outage intensities using 'intensity_type'
E.g. intensity_type = 7;
%3 is outage duration,6 is demand loss,7 is affected customer number.

*note, because of the differences in numerical scales, remember to change all the corresponding parts when changing the intensity_type.

2. Run bootstrapping.m to get the Fig. 2
